## Hi there! 👋  

Curious by nature, I love turning messy data into clear, actionable stories — whether that’s cleaning, digging for hidden patterns, or creating visuals that make things click. ✨

⚡ With a background in finance and growing skills in data engineering, I’m all about using Python, SQL, Power BI, Azure, and AWS to tackle real-world problems with creativity and purpose. 🛠️

What keeps me going? Curiosity, problem-solving, and the idea that data isn’t just numbers — it’s a game-changer. Let’s turn confusion into clarity and make things happen! 🚀💡
